Description: It has functions that support the analysis of the selection of potential roofs of buildings for the development of Verti-hubs, which will be used by air taxis in New York City. To perform this analysis, the package considers lidar data, noise map and other important variables that restrict the flight of these air taxis with eVTOL (electrical Vertical and Take-off and Landing) technology.
